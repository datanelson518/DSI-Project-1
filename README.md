# ACT and SAT Participation Rates

*Jon Nelson*

## Objective

Perform exploratory data analysis on the 2017 data for the standardized exams ACT and SAT to find a recommendation on how to improve SAT participation rates across all of the states in the United States of America.

## Analysis

Explored the average participation rates between the two exams and discovered the ACT to have a higher participation rate.

## Research

One of the reasons for the ACT having higher participation is because 14 states have contracted with the ACT and require the ACT to be taken and 19 states offer this exam for free.

## Recommendation

Target the states with the lower ACT exam scores with the argument that this exam is probably not the optimal exam for their students.

## Reasoning

From looking at the data the states with lower ACT exam scores actually had better SAT scores and weren't far off from the maximum SAT score from all of the states.
